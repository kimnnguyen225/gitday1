## Get to know Kim:
Kim moved to Cincinnati, OH from Vietnam. Exceptionally passionate in IT field, she studied software testing through Per Scholas Technical Institute at the CityLink Center and proceeded to work in a work-life balance, upscale environment, assuring client delight on software quality. Before devoting her full time at Thrive as a Quality Assurance Analyst, Kim spent several years concentrating on chemistry and healthcare related areas at Xavier University.
Kim is an eager traveler, devoted adventurer, and a zealous photographer. When she isn't glued to a computer screen, she enjoys learning lifehacker, spending time working in the garden, doing outdoor activities with her family and friends, volunteering for non-profits and communities such as Reach Out Lakota, Scarlet Oak, Master Provisions and Isaiah House to provide survival need as well as education for self-advancement. She also loves bonding together with her two beautiful nieces and a Bombay cat.
Inspired by B-Corp Thrive and grateful for being a member of its amazing family, as well as the belief system of "pay it forward" and "force for good", Kim help others stepping through life stressors by finding healthy perceptions of themselves and strengthen their relationships so they can feel complete, whole, and safe. She believed that community-building is an art with elusive goals, even if someone gets the physical elements right, thereâ€™s no guarantee that a place will function as a true community, as more than just a place. That said, it really helps to have a good place in which to anchor true community.

At the present time, Kim is joining the bootcamp journey to become a software developer with Mr. Doud and Mr. Blessing (her instructors) for 100 weeks at Max Technical Training locates in Mason, OH

Kim favorite quote is "Think of me as the keeper of the eternal flame of knowledge. Whose mission is to ensure the flame never goes out."
